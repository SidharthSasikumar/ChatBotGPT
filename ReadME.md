# Project Title: AI-Powered Chatbot Deployment on Kubernetes
## Project Description:
Develop an AI-powered chatbot using the ChatGPT API that can answer queries related to cloud computing, containerization, and infrastructure as code. The chatbot will be containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and deployed on AWS with infrastructure managed through Terraform.

## Project Components:
### ChatGPT Integration: 
Use the OpenAI API to integrate the ChatGPT model into your chatbot application, which will be written in Golang.

### Chatbot Application: 
Develop a chatbot application in Golang that interfaces with the ChatGPT API to process and respond to user queries.

### Containerization: 
Dockerize the chatbot application to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

### Kubernetes Orchestration: 
Create Kubernetes manifests to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of the chatbot application containers.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC): 
Use Terraform to define and provision the AWS infrastructure required for hosting the Kubernetes cluster and other necessary resources (e.g., Load Balancers, VPC, Security Groups).

### CI/CD Pipeline: 
Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline to automate the deployment process.

## Project Implementation Steps:
### ChatGPT API Integration: 
Sign up for the OpenAI API and integrate it with your Golang chatbot application to enable AI-powered responses.

### Application Development: 
Develop the chatbot application in Golang, focusing on handling user inputs and formatting responses from the ChatGPT API.

### Dockerization: 
Create a Dockerfile for the chatbot application and build a Docker image.

### Kubernetes Setup: 
Write Kubernetes manifests (e.g., Deployments, Services) to deploy the chatbot application on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Terraform Configuration: 
Define the AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including the Kubernetes cluster, networking, and security configurations.

### CI/CD Implementation: 
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process of the chatbot application.

### Testing and Deployment: 
Test the chatbot application locally, then deploy it to the Kubernetes cluster on AWS using the CI/CD pipeline.
